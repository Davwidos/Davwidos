Passionate about programming and driven by curiosity, my journey in IT commenced during my study of applied mathematics. It was there that I delved into the fundamentals of C++ and SQL, sparking a realization that this was my calling. Eager to expand my skills, I ventured into Java and sought hands-on experience.

Along the way, I immersed myself in the world of web development, exploring HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Node.js. This journey has culminated in a robust portfolio of projects spanning various technologies, underpinned by a strong theoretical background and extensive practical experience.

Excited to continue pushing boundaries and exploring new horizons in the dynamic field of technology!
